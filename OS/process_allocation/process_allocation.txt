### NOTES ###

TAKE INPUT BLOCK SIZE 
TAKE INPUT PROCESS SIZE

WE ARE DOING WORST FIT :)

Clone the block size to duplicate block size

Repeat STEP 1 TILL STEP 4 UNTIL PROCESS SIZE IS TRAVERSED COMPLETELY

STEP 1. FIND THE HIGHEST NUMBER IN THE BLOCK
STEP 2. SUBTRACT IT WITH THE PROCESS 
STEP 3. STORE THE INDEX WHERE THE BLOCK WILL BE STORED
